First try at setting up a repository

Hello world, i'm xpadrex.  I used to do alot of programming in high school using Turing and BASIC, back around 2011 I picked 
up Python and played around with it for a few months until my son was born, then I lacked the time to really do much other 
than work and be a father.  Now hes a little older and I have more time I've been teacing myself C, and will probably move on
to C++ once I'm a little more comfortable with C.
